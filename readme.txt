= 6. What happen, if I update plugin =
When plugins are updated, the plugin/wp-upg folder is deleted and new one is created.
But this will not delete any uploaded post/media. 
If you are using 'personal layout'. Your UPG post may be blank page for 1st time. After refresh it will reappear. 
It copies files from upload folder to layout folder. 
But we advice to take backup before update.

= 7 . How 'personal layout' is different from other layout =
'personal layout' is a layout which is created by you. It is blank at the beginning. 
Whenever you use UPG 'layout editor', it copies the code from other layout to personal layout with the changes you have done.
It creates the physical file placed at wp-content\uploads\ folder. 
When plugin is updated, these files are copied at wp-content\plugins\wp-upg\layout\ folder.
